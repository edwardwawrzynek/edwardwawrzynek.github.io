My name is Edward Wawrzynek. I'm an undergraduate student in electrical engineering and applied mathematics at [CU Boulder](https://colorado.edu). I'm interested in applied electromagnetics, RF systems, and analog electronics in general. 

I'm currently with the [Antenna Research Group](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/antenna/) at CU, where I'm working on developing electrically small antennas (ESAs) for HF communication applications.

I previously worked in the High Speed Digital Engineering Group at CU, where I performed work on high bandwidth interconnects made from conductive inks and developed instrumentation for isothermal I-V characterization.

A good chunk of my younger years were spent interested in software development. I have a recreational interest in fractals and computer graphics and have developed [software in this direction](http://fractal.wawrzynek.com).
