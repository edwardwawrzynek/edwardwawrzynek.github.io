# Education

**BS, Electrical Engineering** and **Applied Mathematics**, Minor in Physics, University of Colorado Boulder, May 2026 (expected).
<div>GPA: 4.0/4.0, Engineering Honors Program</div>

# Technical Skills
I am interested in applied electromagnetic, RF systems, and analog circuit design in general. I have mathematical interest in numerical methods for PDEs and non-linear dynamics.

**Skills**: Circuit design, simulation (ADS, AWR), electromagnetics simulation (HFSS, FEKO), PCB design (Altium), experience with RF test equipment (VNAs, spectrum analyzers, antenna characterization)

**Languages**: C/C++, MATLAB, Python, Verilog, Rust, HTML/CSS/JS.

# Employment
**Research Assistant**, Antenna Research Group, *CU Boulder* <span style="float: right">May 2024 - Present</span>

- Developed electrically small antennas for HF communication applications, including design of a novel elliptically polarized small antenna.

**Research Assistant**, High Speed Digital Engineering Group, *CU Boulder* <span style="float: right">May 2023 - May 2024</span>

- Investigated techniques for designing high bandwidth interconnects with silver nanoparticle (AgNP) conductive inks.
- Fabricated, measured, and modelled microstrip test structures from AgNP inks, demonstrating feasible interconnects to 10 GHz.
- Developed custom instrumentation (circuit, PCB, and software) for pulsed I-V measurements of ink structures, demonstrating I-V under isothermal and heated conditions.
- Investigated characteristics of Cu–AgNP interfaces and techniques for rapid prototyping of ink circuits onto existing copper structures.

**Learning Assistant**, Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, *CU Boulder* <span style="float: right">Aug 2023 - Dec 2023</span>

- Lectured introductory electronics, helped students design and build freshman engineering projects.

# Technical Projects

[Wave Visualization Software](/fdtd_wave_eq.html)

- Created an interactive application to visualize solutions to the wave and heat equations.
- Wrote a finite difference time domain (FDTD) solver for the equations. Developed the solver for GPU acceleration with OpenGL, allowing for realtime visualization of solutions.
- Developed a GUI that allows for graphical construction of boundary and initial conditions. Designed examples demonstrating conditions of phased array antennas, doppler effect, transmission across impedance mismatches, beat frequencies, cavity resonators, and other wave phenomena.
